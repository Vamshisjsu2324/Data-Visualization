# Analysis of the Credits and Grants of The International Development Association (IDA)

There are more than 200 countries in the world. Few of them are recognized as developed
nations and others are developing nations. To overcome these problems and develop their
infrastructure and standard of living, they need financial support from external sources. To help
these countries, the World Bank decided to provide interest-free loans to these countries through
The International Development Association (IDA). IDA is an affiliate and complimentary
institution of the World Bank. It provides financial assistance to the projects being held in
developing countries. There are more than 125 countries that have been benefited from
the IDA since 1960. IDA has been providing loans in 9 regions of the world. 6965 Projects have
been funded by the IDA till today.
In this project, I have analyzed the credits and grants of IDA with the help of
visualizations. For that, I have used Tableau Desktop. It is a visualization tool that helps to create
aesthetic graphs, maps, and charts that are easy to understand and analyze. The dataset used for
this project is IDA Statement of Credits and Grants Historical Data provided by World Bank
Group finances (WBG Finance). Using this dataset the most benefited Regions, Countries,
Borrowers, and Projects have been Identified using visual analysis.

  The motive of this project is to analyze the credits and grants of the International
Development Association. The goals of this project are to build several dashboards by
dividing the important aspects of the dataset. Like, Building dashboards for, analyzing
overall credits provided by the IDA, Country and Region wise beneficiary analysis, and
project wise analysis and details of the most repeated projects in the world. Those dashboards
are expected to be useful for the IDA, beneficiary countries, and the general public to analyze
and understand the aspects and achievements of IDA World Bank. Also, that will be helpful
in knowing the impact of the IDA World Bank in the developments of its beneficiary
countries.
